/**
 * iron-l10n-behavior
 * =======================
 *
 * `Polymer.IronL10nBehavior` provides a normalized interface to localize strings.
 *
 * #### Usage
 *
 * 1) Add Polymer.IronL10nBehavior to the behaviors list in the JS file or script of your component:
 *
 * ```js
 * behaviors: [Polymer.IronL10nBehavior]
 * ```
 *
 * 2) Import the behavior in your HTML:
 *
 * ```html
 * <link rel="import" href="../iron-l10n-behavior/iron-l10n-behavior.html">
 * ```
 *
 * To translate a string, just do the following:
 * ```html
 * {{doTranslation('string_to_localize', lang)}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```

      // propagates bottom-up. This element's children are ready, but parents
      // are not.

      // This is the point where you should make modifications to the DOM (when
      // necessary), or kick off any processes the element wants to perform.

    attached: function() {
      // `attached` fires once the element and its parents have been inserted
      // into a document.
      //
      // This is a good place to perform any work related to your element's
      // visual state or active behavior (measuring sizes, beginning animations,
      // loading resources, etc).

    detached: function() {
      // The analog to `attached`, `detached` fires when the element has been
      // removed from a document.
      //
      // Use this to clean up anything you did in `attached`.
